# 🏥 Rural Interoperable Digital Health Record System

This project addresses the challenge faced by healthcare professionals in rural
areas where patient medical records are fragmented, inconsistent, and insecure.

The system is built using **Next.js (Frontend + Backend)** and is designed to be
**interoperable, privacy-preserving, and cloud-ready (AWS compatible)**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals in rural areas struggle to keep medical records unified.
Different hospitals and clinics use separate systems or paper-based records,
making it difficult to access a patient's complete medical history.

The key challenge is to design a system that:
- Allows seamless sharing of medical records across systems (Interoperability)
- Preserves patient privacy and data security
- Gives patients control over who can access their data

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Create a unified digital health record system
- Enable interoperability using standardized API-based data exchange
- Ensure privacy through encryption and consent-based access
- Support role-based access (Patient, Doctor, Admin)
- Design the system to be ready for AWS cloud deployment
